It is guaranteed to grow over time, though not necessarily in a sequential fashion; for instance, two calls that return 10 and then 1000 respectively are a valid situation. If two calls to FlushAttrs() return the same tag, it means that there were no actual attribute updates in between them, and therefore current flushed state remained the same (for all indexes).
